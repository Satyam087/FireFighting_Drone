Create a futuristic, cinematic hero section and landing page for the firefighting drone-tech startup — “IgniraX.”

🔥 Concept: IgniraX builds AI-powered autonomous drones that protect people from fire — both indoors and outdoors — using eco-safe, chemical extinguishing systems instead of water. The startup focuses on rescue, detection, and prevention.

🖥️ Hero Section Behavior: 1. Begin with multiple fire-related news headlines (based on real incidents where rescue was delayed). 2. Each headline should drop from different angles (CSS transform/rotation) and land at varying positions on the screen. 3. Headlines should be dynamic — editable via a JS array, backend, or CMS so they can be changed later without code edits. 4. After 3–4 seconds, fade out headlines and fade in the tagline: “When seconds matter, IgniraX responds.” 5. Underneath, show a marquee ticker scrolling infinite fire-related updates or simulated alerts (“🔥 Fire in Mumbai warehouse | 🚒 IgniraX in action | 🧯 Rescue ops underway…”). 6. Background: dark gradient (#0b0b0b → #1b1b1b), faint glowing orange (#ff6b00) accents, and a smoke animation overlay for realism. 7. Typography: Urbanist or Poppins, large weight contrast (600–800 for headers).

⚙️ Required Tech Stack:

Frontend: • HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (ES6) for core animations and responsiveness. • GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) → for professional-grade animations (rotating headlines, fade-ins, ticker movement). • Three.js (optional) → to add a faint 3D smoke or drone silhouette effect in background. • Lottie.js → if you want smooth looping drone animations (JSON-based). • Tailwind CSS or SCSS for scalable, modular styling. • Responsive Design: full optimization for mobile + tablet (no overflow, smooth marquee scaling). Backend (optional but recommended for scalability): • Node.js + Express.js → lightweight backend to fetch dynamic headlines or alerts. • MongoDB / Firebase → store fire-related news headlines or updates (for later auto-scroll). • REST API / GraphQL → serve real-time or cached headlines for the hero animation + marquee. Enhancements: • Add dark glassmorphism overlay on hero section text. • Include sound layer (optional) — faint emergency siren hum or static noise (toggleable). • Integrate SEO meta tags and Open Graph previews for sharing (“IgniraX — Fire Rescue from the Sky”). • Include a skip animation button for accessibility.

💡 Overall Aesthetic: • Futuristic, cinematic, and emotionally moving. • Think SpaceX meets rescue tech — sleek UI, dark gradients, minimal orange glows. • Combine urgency (red/orange glow) with calm precision (dark teal shadows).
